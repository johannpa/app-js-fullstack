We are using node js 18.20.7 for this application with nvm.

After create the folder you can use this commands in the terminal :

npm init (It's create a new json file, type enter until the end)

npm i express dotenv mongoose nodemon (express to create the server, dotenv for the environement variable, mongoose for the db mongoDB and nodemon for the live to see if we have errors in direct)
